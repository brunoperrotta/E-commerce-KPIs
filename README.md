A group project developed by me, Matheus Zicarelli and Luana Machado using Power BI to identify the factors that impact user experience in e-commerce.

We focus on the relationship between these five crucial parameters:
Session Duration
Conversion Rate
Number of Sessions
Bounce Rate
Exit Rate

The main insights stem from seasonal increases in conversion and access during European holiday periods. As a result, we were able to provide timely deliverables to the traffic team in pursuit of optimizing e-commerce tools for new customers.
